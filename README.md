# MindTrace

MindTrace is a multi-page cognitive self-awareness web application designed to help users understand their cognitive load, identify behavioral patterns, and make informed task-related decisions.

Unlike basic stress calculators, MindTrace combines a structured questionnaire, rule-based interpretation, and decision support into a clean, explainable, and ethical system.

## Features

- **Cognitive Load Assessment**  
  A 12-question structured assessment evaluating:
  - Cognitive Demand  
  - Emotional Strain  
  - Recovery & Regulation  

- **Archetype Identification**  
  Classifies users into meaningful cognitive profiles such as:
  - Overloaded Multitasker  
  - Emotionally Pressured Achiever  
  - Under-Recovered Performer  
  - Balanced Operator  

- **Risk Signal Detection**  
  Detects early cognitive strain patterns using rule-based logic without making medical claims.

- **Decision Support Mode**  
  Helps users decide whether it is a suitable time to start high-effort tasks based on current cognitive load.

- **Habit Reflection and Trend History**  
  Allows users to log habits affecting mental load and observe patterns over time using client-side storage.

- **Dashboard Navigation**  
  A centralized dashboard to access assessment results, decision support, habit tracking, and reassessment.
